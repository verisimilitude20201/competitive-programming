Problem
-------
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; 
and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem

Example:
-------
Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]

0) [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
    L              H   
    i 

1) [0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2]
    L           H   
    i

2) [0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2]
       L        H   
       i

   [0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2]
       L     H   
       i

   [0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]
       L  H   
       i

3) [0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]
       L  H   
          i

4) [0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]
       L  H   
          i

   [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
       L  H   
          i

Approach
-------
Two Pointers: Move all 0s before low pointer and all 2s after high pointer. Low and high point to 0th and (n - 1)st element


Complexity
---------
    Time: O(N)
    Space: O(1) because it's in-place
